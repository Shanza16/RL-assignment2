# Gridworld RL Assignment

This repository contains solutions to a classic 5×5 Gridworld problem using reinforcement learning techniques.

## Problem Overview

- **Environment**: 5×5 Gridworld with special colored cells:
  -  Blue: +5 reward → jumps to red
  -  Green: +2.5 reward → jumps to red or yellow
  - Discount factor: γ = 0.95

## ✅ Part 1

### Value Function Estimation
- Bellman Equation
- Iterative Policy Evaluation

### Optimal Policy for the gridworld problem
- Solved using:
  - Bellman Optimality Equation
  - Policy Iteration with iterative policy evaluation
  -  policy improvement with value iteration.

## ✅ Part 2

### Monte Carlo Method
- With Exploring Starts
- ε-soft policy without exploring starts
- Off-policy learning using Importance Sampling

## 🖼️ Outputs

- Heatmaps of value functions
- Optimal policy visualizations
