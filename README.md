# Gridworld RL Assignment

This repository contains solutions to a classic 5×5 Gridworld problem using reinforcement learning techniques.

## Problem Overview

- **Environment**: 5×5 Gridworld with special colored cells:
  -  Blue: +5 reward → jumps to red
  -  Green: +2.5 reward → jumps to red or yellow
  - Discount factor: γ = 0.95

##  Part 1

### Value Function Estimation
- Bellman Equation
- Iterative Policy Evaluation

### Optimal Policy for the gridworld problem
- Solved using:
  - Bellman Optimality Equation
  - Policy Iteration with iterative policy evaluation
  -  policy improvement with value iteration.

##  Part 2

### Monte Carlo Method
- With Exploring Starts
- ε-soft policy without exploring starts
- Off-policy learning using Importance Sampling

##  Outputs

- Heatmaps of value functions
- Optimal policy visualizations

##  Requirements
Run this notebook on **Google Colab** – no setup needed beyond these packages:


## How to Run
- open the files in in Google Colab and run one by one.
